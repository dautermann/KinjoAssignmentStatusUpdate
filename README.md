[Here's the assignment](KinjoIOSReal.pdf)!

Meat & potatoes of this challenge are in UpdateManager.swift, but for fun I also embedded this in a SwiftUI project.  

The two included CSV files have disgusting formatting (on purpose, no doubt!) so I wrote a String extension to parse each line from each file.

Use the iOS version which is what I was testing with (using the iPhone 12 Pro simulator).

If you too like to live dangerously, you can try the macOS version of this.  I wasn't able to test that out at all as my personal machine isn't running BigSur yet (I'm waiting on M1/M2 desktops to come out before I spring on a new desktop purchase and my 2009 machine is currently running a patched Catalina) so I was not able to test the macOS version whatsoever
